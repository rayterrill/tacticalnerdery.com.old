> I love to read. It's the primary way I learn new information, and I'm constantly reading something (or more than likely many somethings). These are a few things that have stuck out for me as really useful resources.

<br />

* [The Go Programming Language](https://www.gopl.io/) - Pretty much the definitive guide for Go. I'm still not sure I'm smart enough to understand everything in this book. :)

* [Istio in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/istio-in-action) - A thorough deep dive into Istio. I learned A LOT from this book.

* [Kubernetes in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/kubernetes-in-action) - One of the first books I read about Kubernetes. I still refer back to this occasionally.

* [Kubernetes Operators](https://www.redhat.com/rhdc/managed-files/cl-oreilly-kubernetes-operators-ebook-f21452-202001-en_2.pdf) and [Programming Kubernetes](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-kubernetes/9781492047094/). These two books together helped me get a good grasp of k8s operators and how they can be used to build resources.

* [Google's SRE Series](https://sre.google/books/) - The Google SRE Series is pretty excellent.

* [Tracing the path of network traffic in Kubernetes](https://learnk8s.io/kubernetes-network-packets) - You never can know too much about how the networking magic works in Kubernetes.

* [Oh Shit Git](https://ohshitgit.com/)

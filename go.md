<h2>I <3 Go</h2>

I really enjoy working with Go/golang. Here's a list of things I've found interesting, mostly so I can find them again later:

* <https://github.com/caarlos0/ctrlc> - CTRL-C is a Go library that provides an easy way of having a task that is context-aware and deals with SIGINT and SIGTERM signals.
* <https://github.com/hashicorp/go-retryablehttp> - Automatically retry retriable HTTP errors
* <https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin> - HTTP web framework

<p>I read A LOT of articles, and share a bunch of them with my teammates (probably an overwhelming amount, but I digress). Wanted an easy way to share them with others with an RSS feed, but without a lot of maintenance.</p>
<p>This is a personal project for myself, my teammates, and anyone else who finds it useful.</p>

<h3>What's up with the name?</h3>
I dunno it just sounded decent and was an available domain. :)

### Base Things - Can't Live without These

* [iPad Mini - 64gb Space Gray Wifi](https://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/) - Just got this and love it. Perfect for reading books and articles on the web.
* [Stream Deck Mini](https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck-mini) - I use this to configure Hotkeys and keyboard shortcuts for things I do routinely (there's a running joke on my team about how bad I am at sharing on Zoom - I have a button for that now, but I still kinda suck at it :) ). The Stream Deck supports multiple profiles so you aren't limited to just the 6 programmable buttons, and the profiles can be configured become active when specific apps are in the foreground.
* [Yubikeys](https://www.yubico.com/setup/) - Whenever I'm setting up a new service, the first thing I look for is does it support Yubikey. Brilliant little devices to keep your MFA local and physical while still being extremely convenient. You need these.
